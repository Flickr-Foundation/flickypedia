    # How I did it
    # ============
    #
    # If you look at the map view on Flickr (https://www.flickr.com/map/),
    # there are 17 different zoom levels, which correspond to the
    # different accuracies (0-17, although you can't see accuracy 0
    # on new photos).
    #
    # For each zoom/accuracy level:
    #
    #   1.  Create a new property for "coordinates of the point of view"
    #       in the Wikimedia Commons SDC visual editor.
    #   2.  Click "Select on map"
    #   3.  Zoom the map to roughly match the Flickr map (using the
    #       scale as a guide)
    #   4.  Click a point on the map
    #
    # At this point Wikimedia zooms to a fixed level, and updates its own
    # value for precision (to 1/1000 of an arcsecond, ±0.0001°, etc.)
    #
    # Use that value for precision.
