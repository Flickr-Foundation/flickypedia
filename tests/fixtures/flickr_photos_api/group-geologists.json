      "description": "<i>Digitally analyzing stone trim along the house's southern elevation. The south paw is for scale. I could say that I carefully planned and framed this shot to create a hyperartistic chiaroscuro effect, but the fact is that I just had to put up with the dappling effect of the street trees behind me.</i>\n\nIn my final Robie photo, I'm departing from this series's main theme of brick geology to take a look at the second great exterior building material Frank Lloyd Wright used on this architectural tour de force.  \n\nIt's the Salem Limestone, known to builders as Bedford Stone or Indiana Limestone. And indeed it comes from the southern portion of the Hoosier State, where it has been quarried in such staggering quantities that it's a marvel there's any still attached to the Earth's crust. (But believe, me, there is.)\n\nThe striking Roman Brick from the great production center of St. Louis, Missouri is visible, just barely, at bottom. But it's much better displayed in all its iron-flecked glory in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53283379996/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 12</a>, so I'll pass over it here. \n\nMuch more vivid is the diagonal layering of the Salem. This is a classic sedimentary-rock structure known as <i>crossbedding</i>. It forms in dunes and ripples deposited and moved by flowing  water or wind. For an example of it in a southern-Illinois sandstone outcrop, see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53181572895/in/album-72177720302393036/\">this post</a>. \n\nThe reason this carbonate rock has crossbedding is that it's a <i>biocalcarenite</i> composed of tiny fossils and shell fragments. These came from marine creatures that lived in nearshore inlets, lagoons, and shoals some 340 Ma ago, during the Mississippian subperiod (Lower Carboniferous). The crossbedding often found in the Salem is one indicator that it formed in a high-energy environment of relatively shallow, agitated seawater.\n\n<b>For much more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>.\n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, pay a visit to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302658037\">my <i>Geobrickology</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",

      "description": "Pamukkale, meaning &quot;cotton castle&quot; in Turkish, is a natural site in Denizli Province in southwestern Turkey. The area is famous for a carbonate mineral left by the flowing of thermal spring water.[1][2] It is located in Turkeys Inner Aegean region, in the River Menderes valley, which has a temperate climate for most of the year.\n\nThe ancient Greek city of Hierapolis was built on top of the travertine formation which is in total about 2,700 metres (8,860 ft) long, 600 m (1,970 ft) wide and 160 m (525 ft) high. It can be seen from the hills on the opposite side of the valley in the town of Denizli, 20 km away. This area has been drawing visitors to its thermal springs since the time of classical antiquity.[1] The Turkish name refers to the surface of the shimmering, snow-white limestone, shaped over millennia by calcite-rich springs.[2] Dripping slowly down the mountainside, mineral-rich waters collect in and cascade down the mineral terraces, into pools below.\n\nPamukkale sinter terraces\nIt was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 along with Hierapolis.\n\nGeology\n\nTravertine terrace formations\nPamukkale's terraces are made of travertine, a sedimentary rock deposited by mineral water from the hot springs.[1] In this area, there are 17 hot springs with temperatures ranging from 35 \u00b0C (95 \u00b0F) to 100 \u00b0C (212 \u00b0F). The water that emerges from the spring is transported 320 metres (1,050 ft) to the head of the travertine terraces and deposits calcium carbonate on a section 60 to 70 metres (200 to 230 ft) long covering an expanse of 24 metres (79 ft) to 30 metres (98 ft). When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate, reaches the surface, carbon dioxide de-gasses from it, and calcium carbonate is deposited. Calcium carbonate is deposited by the water as a soft gel which eventually crystallizes into travertine.\n\nArchaeology\nTravertine terraces at a hot spring at Pamukkale\nThere are only a few historical facts known about the origin of the city. No traces of the presence of Hittites or Persians have been found. The Phrygians built a temple, probably in the first half of the 7th century BC. This temple, originally used by the citizens of the nearby town of Laodicea, would later form the centre of Hierapolis.\n\nPools inside the archeological site\nHierapolis was founded as a thermal spa early in the 2nd century BC within the sphere of the Seleucid Empire. Antiochus the Great sent 2,000 Jewish families to Lydia and Phrygia from Babylon and Mesopotamia, later joined by more from Judea. The Jewish congregation grew in Hierapolis and has been estimated as high as 50,000 in 62 BC.[3] Hierapolis became a healing centre where doctors used the thermal springs as a treatment for their patients. The city began minting bronze coins in the 2nd century BC. These coins give the name Hieropolis. It remains unclear whether this name referred to the original temple (\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd, hieron) or honoured Hiera, the wife of Telephus, son of Heracles and the Mysian princess Auge. This name eventually changed into Hierapolis (&quot;holy city&quot;).[4] In 133 BC, when Attalus III died, he bequeathed his kingdom to Rome. Hierapolis thus became part of the Roman province of Asia. In AD 17, during the rule of Emperor Tiberius, a major earthquake destroyed the city.\n\nThrough the influence of the Christian Apostle Paul, a church was founded here while he was at Ephesus.[5] The Christian Apostle Philip spent the last years of his life here.[6] The town's Martyrium was alleged to have been built upon the spot where Philip was crucified in AD 80. His daughters were also said to have acted as prophetesses in the region.[7][8] During the 4th century, the Christians filled Pluto's Gate (a ploutonion) with stones, suggesting that Christianity had become the dominant religion and had begun displacing other faiths in the area. Originally a see of Phrygia Pacatiana,[9] the Byzantine Emperor Justinian raised the bishop of Hierapolis to the rank of metropolitan in 531. The Roman baths were transformed to a Christian basilica. During the Byzantine period, the city continued to flourish and also remained an important centre for Christianity. Wikipedia ",

      "description": "There's actually quite a bit to this image, if you look at it long enough. First, for the Big Stuff: The Athabasca Glacier. According to Wikipedia, this glacier is &quot;one of six principal 'toes' of the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park. It loses about 16 feet (5 meters) per year and has receded almost a mile (1.5 km) and has lost half of its volume in the past 125 years. That may seem slow to you in this age of climate change and global warming, and only a blip in the geological record, but it's still quite a bit and really hits home as one hikes the trail to the toe of this glacier, reading signs along the way of where the glacier toe *used* to be before receding.\n\nIf you look closely at this image, to the far left, you can see a line of tiny black dots. Those are people on a guided hike out onto the glacier. A guided hike is the only way you can actually stand on the glacier if you don't feel like taking a big ice bus loaded with people out onto the glacier. Other than that, you are prohibited from going solo onto the glacier, and with good reason. Along the way are hidden holes covered by glacial till (rocks and sediment) filled with freezing, rushing water that could suck you under. Then, once you are out on the glacier, unless you know what to look for, you could easily slip and fall into a hidden crevasse. Both of those would ruin an otherwise perfectly nice day because it's pretty cold up there, even in the summer. \n\nDYK the glacier makes it's own weather, including winds known as &quot;katabatic winds&quot; which blow down the glacier and towards the hiker. I can tell you for a fact that it was pretty darned cold on the day I hiked the trail.\n\nSee that rock in the foreground of this image? See the striations (lines) gouged into the rock? Those striations were created by the weight of, and suspended rocks in, the glacier. Weight and ice together ground scratches into the rock as the glacial ice moved forward then receded. You can tell the direction the glacier moved by these scratches.\n\nPhotographically, this single composition is composed of two focus-stacked images. One image was focused for the glacier and landscape in the background and the other image was focused for the striated rock in the foreground. That was really the only way to get a completely (or almost completely) focused image of the entire area, even using a wide angle lens, which is what I used on my Fujifilm GFX100s medium format camera. The 23mm lens is analogous to a 17mm lens on a 35mm camera.",

      "description": "<i>Facing northeastward toward the western elevation.</i>\n\nEven relatively modest stone buildings are brimming over with geologic interest. For example, this oblique view shows the toll the process of weathering has exacted from ashlar (in this case, presumably the Upper Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone) subjected to the elements for nine centuries.\n\nIn various spots on the church's exterior it's evident that the blocks' outer surfaces have fallen away. This may be a simple case of water soaking into the porous sedimentary rock and eventually breaking down its cement matrix. \n\nHowever, it may also signal the presence of <i>case hardening</i>, where solutions migrating through the rock have deposited minerals on the surface, and turned it hard and brittle. This comes at the expense of the inner portion, which becomes soft, crumbly, and very vulnerable to decay when finally exposed. \n\nInterestingly, much more recent Google Earth Street View imagery reveals that those weathered faces are still there. So apparently the Segovia Sandstone, even when degraded, changes little over the span of a single human lifetime\u2014at least in this rather protected spot, hemmed in by other buildings.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720307451632\"><i>Architectural Geology: Spain</i> album</a>.</b>   \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Taken along Great Lake Road, in the National Forest's Pond Pine Wilderness. This spot is about 10 mi (16 km) south-southwest of the town of Havelock.</i>\n\nOccasionally I revisit photos I posted on Flickr quite a while ago and flesh out their descriptions, to the consternation of those visitors who can't tolerate anything longer than tweet-sized commentary. And then I add them if possible to a series I've established subsequently. \n\nSuch was the case with this set's <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52288349284/in/album-72177720309413739/\">Part 14</a>, which shows a nice stand of Pond Pine (<i>Pinus serotina</i>) growing in a special kind of Coastal Plain peatland known as a <i>pocosin</i>. This is pronounced <b>puh-COE-zin</b>, as I learned from a Croatan NF staffer. Before she diplomatically corrected me, I was trying to make it <b>POCK-ah-sun</b>, to rhyme with moccasin. \n\nApparently this word, whether spoken correctly or not, derives from an Algonquian term for &quot;wetland in a high place,&quot; or something similar. That's a good description, because pocosins are generally classified as one type of raised bog, with a subtly domed profile.\n\nThis shot, like the one cited above, shows Pond Pines growing very happily indeed in the sandy, mucky Histosol (organic soil). The plants that inhabit this boggy substrate have adapted to unusually low-pH (acidic) conditions.  \n\n<b>The other photos and descriptions of this series can be found in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720309413739\">my <i>Botany of the Carolinas Coastal Plain</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n  ",

      "description": "<i>Taken along Catfish Lake Farm Road, about 7.4 mi (12 km) southeast of Pollocksville.</i>\n\nThe Gulf-Atlantic Coastal Plain is such a wonderful region for pine-spotting. This species, growing in the fascinating Southeastern type of peatland known as a <i>pocosin</i>, is Pond Pine, <i>Pinus serotina</i>. \n\nMany members of this much-beloved and much-utilized needle-leaved genus thrive in dry or rocky soils. But the <i>P. serotina</i> makes its home instead in this boggy wetland habitat, which is notable for its poor drainage and waterlogged Histosol (organic soil) with considerable sand content. It's a highly acidic environment. \n\nFrom what I've read, ecologists have further subdivided pocosins into specific categories. This one, I simply have to assume, is the Pond Pine Woodland association. It's characteristically found where the peatland has a slightly domed surface.\n\nAs an old bogtrotter much more familiar with peatlands from Downeast Maine to the Indiana Dunes and Michigan's Upper Peninsula, this pocosin variant came as quite a revelation to me. \n\nMore shots of this locale in Croatan follow.\n\n<b>The other photos and descriptions of this series can be found in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720309413739\">my <i>Botany of the Carolinas Coastal Plain</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Looking northeastward, at the church's southern and western elevations. It was a splendid early-spring day in this Upper Illinois River Valley town. What a lovely blue sky with cumulus fractus clouds.</i>\n\nWhile by no means the Prairie State's most imposing house of worship, the Gothic-Revival First Presbyterian of Morris has a lot to commend it, geologically.\n\nTo begin with, it was built fourteen years before Chicago's 1871 Great Fire (or actually its <i>first</i> Great Fire; there was also one in 1874). Due to a paucity of records, I'm not sure of the exact source of striking fieldstone that adorns this building's  exterior. But I assume the builders did what their equivalents in other regional communities did, and harvested <i>erratics</i> (glacially transported boulders) from local farm fields.\n\nA lot of effort went into mounting those boulders. Almost certainly they were split and mounted rubble-style with their flat faces inward. However, their outward faces may have been worked, too. They have a rock-faced texture, but do not project out much, as do the stones at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53100065302/in/album-72177720310008578/\">Chicago's Epworth United Methodist Church</a>.\n\nWhat strikes my eye the most, though, is the high proportion of pink-to-red alkali-feldspar granites. Perhaps the masons preferentially selected them for their cheerful color. Or it may just be that the Wisconsin-stage ice sheet dumped a lot of them in this vicinity.  \n\nHowever, the church's reddest erratics are rhyolite, the extrusive equivalent of granite. We'll take a closer look at them and many of their companions before long.\n\n<b>To peruse the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720310008578\"><i>Geology of Fieldstone &amp; Cobblestone Buildings</i> album</a>.</b>  \n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>I've finally made it to the relative saftety of the sidewalk. Looking up Clark Street, at the building's northern half.</i>\n\nFor my current book-writing project, <i>Chicago Suburbs in Stone and Clay</i>, I've been reviewing for the umpteenth time the surprisingly abundant geologic literature on the sand-and-gravel spits that now form low ridges in the city, the North Shore, and Oak Park and Forest Park areas. \n\nThis foray into spitology reminded me that North Clark and its unusual northwest-southeast trend is the result of its being the crest of the Graceland Spit. This landform, named for the graveyard I feature prominently in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513\">my <i>Cemetery Science</i> album</a>, was built in the nearshore waters of Lake Chicago during its Nipissing phases, about 5.5 ka ago. \n\nIn previous shots of this series, I've described the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company cladding, formed from Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) clays mined in the Illinois Basin, that adorns the lower portion of this storage warehouse. Here it is at much closer range.\n\nOf course the most eye-catching item is the olive-skinned representation of one of the original Reebie Brothers decked out as Ramses II. His sibling is an identical Ramses II, out of sight on the other side of the entrance. \n\nBut the rest of the building's face is a nice assortment of botanical references, especially to <i>Nymphaea lotus</i>, the Egyptian Lotus. This aquatic plant was to the ancients a potent symbol of death and resurrection. Its flower buds emerge and rise above the waters of the Nile and open by day, then close and submerge again at night, and reemerge the following day.\n\nThe Egyptian Lotus is present here both in closed-bud and opened-flower forms. And there are also palm-leaf motifs in the capitals of the squat columns. \n\n<b>For more on this site, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nTo see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670488\"><i>Terra-Cottalogy</i> album</a>.</b> \n \n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Taken from the roof of the Natural Bridge, a little farther across the span than the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53271012034/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 5</a> location.</i>\n\nHere we're looking at the gap between the Bridge and the bluff. I especially like this shot because it shows a good uniformitarian process: water, that great and patient eroder, flows over the lip of the cliff. Year after year, decade after decade, century after century, little spring-freshet streams like this gradually widen what was once a narrow <i>joint</i>\u2014a fracture in bedrock where no appreciative displacement has occurred between the two sides. \n\nAnd in this case, what was once part of the cliff eventually became a detached slice of rock, hollowed out below when the water hit a shale layer and had to move outward rather than farther downward.\n\nThis water and rock are also the basis of all the green communities, algal films to tall-growing vascular plants, than live atop and on the sides of the exposed Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) Pounds Sandstone. Any geologist who is not also enraptured by the biota, and any biologist blind to the geology, are missing the essential fusion of things that makes all divisions of scientific study artificial constructions. \n\n<b>For more on this beautiful and geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/\"><i>Geology Underfoot in Illinois</i></a>. \n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302393036\"><i>Natural History: Illinois</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>To be more specific, the view is from the porch on the building's eastern side.</i>\n\nHere there's plenty of what I take to be Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa, or some other source near Milwaukee. But in this description I focus instead on the stout, polished column shafts.\n\nAs I noted in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53267563072/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 11</a>, the shafts were fashioned from blocks of Montello Granite, an igneous intrusive rock with a mineralogical composition that is reputedly up to 40 percent quartz. This means that the effort it took to cut, shape, and polish this stone was much greater than it would have been to process competing granite varieties. One example of this: whereas a cutting wire works through about 4 ft (1.2 m) of normal granite per hour; the same device only makes it through 8 in (0.2 m) of the Montello in the same amount of time. \n\nNaturally, this drove up the latter's price\u2014as did the fact that only about 10 percent of the rock extracted at the Montello, Wisconsin quarry was deemed suitable for architectural or monumental use.\n\nClassed as an alkali-feldspar granite, the Montello has been dated to about 1.75 Ga in the Paleoproterozoic era. This is interesting, given that that timeframe lies about 100 Ma after the Penokean Orogeny and about 50 Ma before the Yavapai Orogeny. Such crust-crunching, mountain-building events are thought to be a main source of granite-pluton production. But this sort of activity was noticeably absent in Wisconsin at 1.75 Ga. \n\nHowever, alkali-feldspar granites are thought to often originate in a different way, in extensional environments\u2014where the crust is being pulled, thinned, and rifted. So perhaps that was the case when the bodies of magma that formed the Montello and associated extrusive rhyolites rose from the lower crust. One mechanism that causes such extension is called <i>slab rollback</i>. It occurs when subducting oceanic crust steepens its angle and causes the adjacent continental margin to stretch. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302395101\"><i>Architectural Geology: Southwestern Wisconsin</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing southwestward, from what was then a nice bed of hybrid tea roses toward the temple's eastern and northern elevations.</i>\n\nPaestum's three splendid Doric temples are largely constructed with a rock type I informally call the Paestum Travertine. It should not be confused with the much more famous and much more widely utilized Tivoli Travertine quarried far to the north, in the Acque Albule region west of Rome (and found in some abundance even on modern buildings in my barbarian Trans-Atlantic region). \n\nThe Paestum rock type, like the Tivoli, derives from a carbonate deposit formed from calcium-rich water. In this case, the water source was the nearby Capodifiume springs, which from the Pleistocene epoch to the present have apparently built out this site's surrounding coastal plain quite significantly. \n\nAnother Quaternary-period building material found on the First Temple of Hera is a very young clastic rock, taken from  Holocene dune ridges, which I identify as the Paestum Sandstone. It was used on the structure's upper portions, particularly the metopes.\n\nBoth of these locally quarried selections are probably endemic to this archaeological site. But they certainly have withstood the test of time to a remarkable degree.\n\nPhotos and descriptions of Hera's Second Temple, and of Athena's only one, will follow. \n\n\n ",

      "description": "<i>Looking at the central and eastern portions of the building's facade (southern elevation). </i>\n\nI keep trying to put all of its design elements together in my mind as some sort of coherent whole, but can never quite make it. Still, from a geological standpoint, Old City Hall is certainly a fascinating farrago of different materials one can scrutinize as though they're their own separate entities floating free of one another.\n\nFirst, of course, is all that terrific, maroon-and-mottled rock. It's locally quarried Jacobsville Sandstone, which was deposited atop the great mafic lava outpourings of the Midcontinent Rift (MCR). The rifting event itself was possibly caused by a rare combination of two separate events:\n\n- Crustal thinning and extension caused by the separation of Laurentia (ancestral North America) from Amazonia, and\n\n- This part of Laurentia passing over a mantle plume.\n\nWhile the eruptive phase of the MCR is constrained quite nicely to ca. 1.1 Ga (Upper Mesoproterozoic era), it's not known for sure how long afterward the Jacobsville was deposited. Estimates have ranged from <i>very</i> late Mesoproterozoic to early Cambrian, an uncomfortably long span of about 500 Ma. Unfortunately this rock type lacks index fossils and other diagnostic features geochronologists rely on.\n\nThe Jacobsville is complemented by a lot of lighter-toned Marquette Brick, another buillding material produced in this locale. I've discussed it a bit more fully in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53205525427/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 21 of this set</a>.\n\nAnd while I can find no proof of this yet, I'm guessing the porch's column shafts are Montello Granite, the red, quartz-saturated igneous rock from the town of that name in Wisconsin. It's also possible that it's the Peterhead variety of Scotland's Aberdeenshire Granite. But by the 1890s most courthouse and town-hall architects in the Upper Midwest were using the domestically produced Montello. \n\nClose-ups of the facade will follow. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720306314298\"><i>The Brownstone Chronicles</i> album</a>. </b>\n\n\n  \n\n  ",

This member of the Pineapple Family (Bromeliaceae) has adapted itself to Big Bend's parched and infernal Chihuahuan Desert conditions. Wherever I found it in the park, I photographed it and marveled at its affinity for living in cracks and crevices of Cretaceous-limestone outcrops, as here.\n\nUnlike the plants shown in the previous shot, this individual was not in flower. But it does display the salient characteristics of its narrow, sharply toothed leaves. Those lower in the rosette are flushed deep red; the upper ones show the silvery scales that are, I assume, a moisture-retaining adaptation. \n\nWhile as noted in earlier descriptions I roundly dislike this species's common name, False Agave, I have to admit that the plant often does have a more regularly radial, agave-ish habit. But here the foliage is quite inrolled and contorted, to the point it almost seems to belong to a <i>Tillandsia</i> &quot;air plant&quot; instead. But, dagnabbit, <i>H. texensis</i> this specimen surely is.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this set and my other Big Bend series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52619713656/in/album-72177720302655904/\">my <i>Natural History: Big Bend Region &amp; All of Trans-Pecos Texas</i> album</a>.</b>\n",

      "description": "<i>Gazing westward toward the monumental, slot-in-the-hill entrance to this tholos, which is also known as the &quot;Tomb of Agamemnon.&quot;</i> \n\n<b>Behold Bronze Age Building Skills at Their Boldest! \nStonework on Steroids! Colossal Chunks of Conglomerate! Amazing Ashlar! Massive Masonry! Lovely Lithic Artistry! Petrologic Perfection!</b>\n\nNow that I've gotten that disturbing alliterative outburst out of my system, let me identify the stone a little more precisely as the coarse-textured clastic sedimentary rock I informally call the Mycenae Conglomerate. Pliocene to Pleistocene in age, it was quarried on the floor of the Argos Graben nearby. It's also seen extensively in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52322614536/in/album-72177720303812060/\">the walls of Mycenae's citadel</a>, just 0.4 km (0.25 mi) to the northeast. \n\nI've come across various accounts of fancier stone types that were originally used to adorn this beehive tomb. I'll discuss one or two of them in the following photo's description. \n\nHere, however, it's worth noting that at least one reference mentions that the front exterior was clad in some sort of &quot;marble&quot; from the southern part of the Peloponnese. Whether this was the striking green Krokees Porphyry (known in Italian stonemason lingo as the &quot;Porfido verde antico&quot;), I'm not sure. Greece is so rich in nifty rock types that one has only to walk about fourteen paces from an outcrop of one variety to find yet another. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303812060\"><i>Mycenaean Magic: Bronze-Age Stonework</i> album</a>.</b> ",

      "description": "<i>Looking eastward, so this is the western elevation. This site is situated in the Plaka, in a narrow defile on the northern flank of the Acropolis.</i> \n\nSources I've come across describe this church's subsequent modifications in less than admiring terms. And indeed, its facade seems to have been redone by the local equivalent of the Impromptu Fixit Company, employing a decidedly sloppy and randomized style quite alien to the meticulous artistry of  Middle Byzantine masons. \n\nI'm not sure if all that rubble stone now adorning the front is the standard <i>poros</i>\u2014marly Pliocene limestone quarried in Piraeus and Megara. But it looks as though the ashlar of the lovely and better-preserved Athenian-style dome is in fact the genuine article. \n\nAlso preserved in the dome's drum is the standard cloisonn\u00e9 masonry technique, where the blocks of the pitted, fosiliferous carbonate rock are separated with thin red brick. And speaking of brick: there's all that characteristic archwork in that medium, too.  \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303792872\"><i>Byzantine and Late Roman Worlds</i> album</a>.</b>",

      "description": "Even at this closer range we can't really discern the subtle, fine-grained texture of the Permian-period Narragansett Pier Granite used throughout this lofty and ornate monument.  But we do have a much finer view of the three allegorical female figures perched on its upper surfaces.\n\nWhen it comes to this ensemble of symbol-laden ladies, the old salt in me feels an instinctive preference for the one clutching an anchor. But of course the most dramatic of the bunch is the standing and more fully illuminated woman gesturing heavenward. Note the cross she carries in her left hand. It's festooned with Easter Lilies (<i>Lilium longiflorum</i>), plants that have long served as a Christian emblem of the Resurrection.  \n\nThe graveyard botany doesn't stop there, however. As noted in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53250733547/in/dateposted-public/\">the previous photo of this set</a>, the rich green foliage of a mature Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>) provides an effective backdrop. \n\nFor more on the geologic origins of the Narragansett Pier, click the Part 14 link in the preceding paragraph. Subsequent close-ups of this stone will reveal its mineralogical makeup.\n\n<b>To learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority to get a copy of my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nAnd to peruse the other photos and descriptions in this series, pay a visit to my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513\"><b><i>Cemetery Science</i></b> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Gazing down at the rocky debris on the floor of the intermittent Blue Creek, in Tuff Canyon.</i>\n\nIn <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53249755023/in/dateposted-public/\">the previous photo of this series</a> I pointed out what I think is a <i>lahar</i> (volcanic mudflow) deposit in the canyon's lower wall. And I surmise that the detached chunk of stone shown here may have come from such a bed.\n\nI was once told by some instructor or fellow geologist that lahars can often be identified by a greater density of large rock fragments than is normally found in air falls found adjacent to them. This makes eminent sense to me, given the considerable hefting power of a mudflow coursing down a slope or stream channel. But in this case I stand ready to be corrected by anyone with a better grasp of igneous petrology and lithology than I. Alas, I was born in Illinois, not Iceland.\n\nAt any rate, this boulder, whose true size is indicated by the Sharpie pen artfully placed atop it for scale, is worthy of a little scrutiny. Whether it originated in a lahar flow or not, there's no doubting that it's a <i>breccia</i> rather than a plain old conglomerate. This because its clasts (component rock fragments) are mostly angular rather than quite rounded. \n\nThe darkest of its fragments are almost certainly Oligocene-epoch Bee Mountain Basalt, the unit also found cropping out at the base of the canyon cliffs. The gray to olive-weathering chunks may be another lava type, trachyandesite, or possibly ash-fall tuff.\n\nSome of the other, smaller rocks in this shot appear to be porphyritic specimens of various igneous types, with larger crystals (<i>phenocrysts</i>) set in a much finer groundmass. And there are some notable lumps of black and apparently aphanitic basalt. \n\n<b>My other photos and descriptions in this series can be found in my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302655904\"><i>Canyonlands</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n  \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Looking at one wee portion of the building's western elevation. At last I've made direct tactile contact with this famous Prairie School edifice.</i>\n\nArchitect Frank Lloyd Wright, who had a penchant for designing really snazzy Nineteen-Fifties houses in the Nineteen-Aughts, here chose a premium-quality building material manufactured to his exacting specifications, in what was then the Midwest's greatest brick production center: St. Louis, Missouri. In fact, FLW actually traveled to that great river city, no doubt at Mr. Robie's expense, to make sure he got exactly what he wanted. \n\nAnd what he wanted was long-and-low Roman Brick that measured 11-5/8 x 4 x 1-5/8 in (29.5 x 10.2 x 4.1 cm) and featured, in addition to its rich-red base color, copious silver-gray flecking. The latter was produced by firing the bricks at an especially high kiln temperature that encouraged their clay's   iron content to migrate to the surface and congeal there.   \n\nClay for common-variety St. Louis Brick came from the city's abundant Pleistocene-epoch deposits of <i>loess</i> (windblown, glacially derived silt) that mantles the Mississippi River bluff. However, facing-quality brick such as the Robie's was made from the Cheltenham Clay, a Pennsylvanian-subperiod (Upper Carboniferous) coal-swamp underclay (<i>paleosol</i>, or ancient soil) mined in shafts under the city.       \n\nOnce this special consignment of Roman, St. Louis, iron-flecked bricks arrived on site, Wright directed his masons to lay them in two different mortars: \n\n- a normal buff-colored type for the horizontal joints, carefully raked out to enhance shadowing, and \n\n- a red mixture for the vertical joints that blended so well with the brick itself that even from a close distance the viewer sees not individual units of fired clay but continuous stripes, akin to the flat-lying sedimentary strata of  northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin.\n\nThe result of all is that the Robie House's profound sense of horizontality is intensified even more. \n\n<b>For much more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>.\n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, pay a visit to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302658037\">my <i>Geobrickology</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i> Looking eastward at the main portal, situated at the northwestern corner of this church-turned-museum.</i> \n\nAs I noted in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53187912844/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 21 of this series</a>, I'm not sure whether this elaborately ornamented, Gothic-style pointed archway is a later add-on, but I assume it is, for reasons already discussed in the earlier description. At any rate, the amount of carved detail in what I take to be the Segovia Sandstone is impressive and fascinating to scrutinize.\n\nRegarding the angelic painting of the tympanum, I can't quite tell from modern imagery whether it's still there. To my untutored eye, its seraphim (?) fluttering about the Godhead certainly look Romanesque or Gothic, or at least Romanesque-ish or Gothic-ish.\n\nThe Segovia Sandstone that gives San Juan and the city's later churches such a distinctive look dates to the waning phase of the Cretaceous period. Having just digested a hefty compendium of technical papers on the stratigraphy and tectonic history of Spain, I can say that this handsome golden-toned rock unit was deposited on the flank of the Iberian Peninsula's Central Range, which includes the nearby Guadarrama Mountains. \n\nThe Central Range is largely composed of granitoid plutons injected into the upper crust during the end-of-the-Paleozoic Variscan Orogeny. This enduring igneous rock, including the Guadarrama Granite visible today in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52875633471/in/album-72177720307451632/\">the Segovia Aqueduct</a>, was subsequently uplifted during the next crust-compressing, mountain-building episode, the Alpine Orogeny, which began in the Upper Cretaceous.   \n\nAt about the same time, the Segovia Sandstone came into being as part of a transgressive sequence of shallow-water (intertidal to lagoonal) sedimentary strata deposited on a carbonate platform. These strata also included limestone and dolostone. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720307451632\"><i>Architectural Geology: Spain</i> album</a>.</b>   \n\n   ",

      "description": "<i>Looking at one section of the facade (western elevation).</i>\n\nIn this final shot of the Dodge House, I've chosen one spot on the exterior that is quite representative of all of the cobblework. I'm not sure why, but I find the not-so-simple artfulness of the place mesmerizing.\n\nI think it's the combination of the stones, so carefully segregated by geologic type, and the little mortar boxes that hold them as though they're accessioned museum specimens lying in a cabinet tray. There are the black Mesoproterozoic basalts, emissaries from the cataclysmic Midcontinent Rift event; the even older pink and gray granitoids of North America's ancient core; the Silurian dolostones, at 425 Ma the youngsters of the lot.   \n\nIf you peer at these long enough, you'll sense that for all their implied tidiness there's actually a lot of tomfoolery going on. One sees this in the relentless regularity of various irregularities: in the differing thicknesses of dark, medium, and light bands, and in what angle the cobbles of each course are set. \n\nAny attempt to find a grand repeating pattern leads to madness. However meticulous the Dodges meant to be, they expressed something quite amazingly subconscious, a kind of architectural Ouija-board message in letters of stone. But to understand exactly what I mean by this, you really have to see the place for yourself. \n\n<b>To peruse the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720310008578\"><i>Geology of Fieldstone &amp; Cobblestone Buildings</i> album</a>.</b>  ",

      "description": "<i>This shot, like <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53237534859/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 11</a>, displays my lack of good sense in that it was taken in the middle of North Clark Street, a place where absentminded photographic pedestrians normally should not stand.</i>\n\nWhile the viewer's eye is naturally drawn to all that sumptuous, Egyptianate terra-cotta on the ground floor (and in those snazzy window surrounds on the second level as well), I now focus on the much plainer upper facade. In future shots of this series I'll return to the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company artistry below\u2014including the arrestingly olive-green pharaohs that flank the main entrance.\n\nThe reason the stuff above is worthy of mention is that it is, unless I'm cruelly mistaken, white <i>glazed</i> or <i>enameled brick</i>. These types of glossy-coated bricking are venerable forms of architectural ornamentation in their own right. \n\nThe glazed  variety was used at least as far back as the ancient Babylonians (e. g., in their city's magnificent Ishtar Gate, of the sixth century BC). The enameled kind, on the other hand, was pioneered in the American Middle West by the Tiffany Company of Momence, Illinois. At first it was used primarily for interior hallways, bathrooms, and to provide highly reflective walls for office-building light wells. But then it caught on, at just about the beginning of the twentieth century, as decorative facade cladding, too.\n\nWhether the bricks here are enameled (with the outer coating agent fused by very high kiln heat into the brick itself) or just glazed (with an unfused coat that sits outside the brick), they're remarkably like architectural terra-cotta in their ability to be washed and maintained easily.\n\nAnother bit of interest in the Reebie Warehouse's glazed or enameled bricks is that they're set in a pattern known as <i>running bond</i>. In this arrangement, one of the most frequently used by masons, all the bricks are set as <i>stretchers</i> (with their long sides exposed to view). And each stretcher of one course (row) is centered directly above the joint between two stretchers of the course directly below.\n\nIn many other bonds, <i>headers</i> (short brick ends) also make an appearance in one way or another. But the running bond, as you can see here, is absolutely headerless. \n\n<b>For more on this site, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nTo see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670488\"><i>Terra-Cottalogy</i> album</a>.</b> \n \n\n\n \n\n  ",

      "description": "From a tour guide's perspective, it's one thing to walk around the narrow roof of the Natural Bridge when all alone, and quite another to herd a gaggle of tour participants across it. Half of the group are birdwatchers obsessed with a chickadee on a distant tree branch; the others are the daredevil type too damned curious about what lies over the edge. A misdirected step and unintended nose-dive into the boulders below are all too imaginable.\n\nBut then it's time for the guide to do some diaphragmatic breathing, and just relax. After all, everyone is enjoying the lovely spring day, and overtly grateful that you've brought them here. And besides, they've all signed waivers releasing you from personal liability.\n\nAs it turns out, those waivers were probably not worth the paper they were printed on. Still, here you are years later, basking in the memory that you lost no one and killed no one and didn't even have a single sprained ankle on all of those trips to darken your name.\n\nAnd now, peering at this one moment frozen in time, you can turn your attention to an appreciation of nature shorn of all responsibility. You can meditate on the old fork-trunked ash tree, the same one shown from below in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/\">Part 1</a>. Or you can ponder the moss-and-lichen-dappled Pounds Sandstone, which 320 Ma before had been a stream deposit in another, much earlier bedrock canyon.\n\n<b>For more on this beautiful and geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52320461783/in/album-72177720302393036/\"><i>Geology Underfoot in Illinois</i></a>. \n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302393036\"><i>Natural History: Illinois</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Looking northwestward toward one section of the courthouse's eastern elevation.</i>\n\nThis portion of this Richardsonian Romanesque building reminds me powerfully of the arcaded porches of the original version of the Romanesque style, as articulated in the churches of Segovia, Spain. Here's <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53042100663/in/album-72177720307451632/\">one example of that</a>.\n\nThe three main exterior building materials, all products of Wisconsin, are visible in this shot, though the richly red Maiden Rock Brick here takes a back seat to the great mass of Regional Silurian Dolostone. Note the striking checkerboard of gaps and widely spaced ashlar blocks under the columns. This is what is known, believe it or not, as <i>hit-or-miss masonry</i>. It's much more commonly used in garden-wall brickwork, where the builders want some air and light to come through. There's actually nothing hit-or-miss about it; it requires  quite some skill to get the pattern right.\n\nAs I noted in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53212741652/in/dateposted-public/\">the Part 10 description</a>, I'm guessing that the buff-to-buttery-yellow ashlar is specifically Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River Valley just west of Milwaukee. If it isn't, though, it comes from another locality in the eastern portion of the Badger State.\n\nAnd then there are those beautiful gleaming column shafts of Montello Granite. This intrusive igneous rock was a costly and  premium-grade selection. Paleoproterozoic in age, it has an unusually high quartz content that made it devilishly difficult to cut, shape, and polish. But when all that extra effort was taken, the result was what may well be the most enduring of all building and monumental stones. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302395101\"><i>Architectural Geology: Southwestern Wisconsin</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing northward. Taken from the palace's entrance.</i>\n\nThroughout this set showing this splendid building in its former ruinous state, I have made reference to a flock of free-range chickens who accompanied me on my exploration of this roofless hulk. \n\nHere, at long last, they make an appearance, pecking away in the middle ground. And to their left, there's also a free-range rooster perched on the lowest course of ashlar of the Blachernae Walls. He looks like a road-crew foreman, standing around idly and telling everyone else what to do.\n\nIf you now visit the fully restored building, which serves as the Tekfur Saray\u0131 Museum, you probably won't have fine feathered tour guides. But you'll still behold all that lovely Late Byzantine masonry, with its combination of locally quarried, Miocene Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Limestone and contrasting belt courses of red brick. To see it at its best, at least as I saw it half a century ago, take a look at <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53116995519/in/album-72177720303792872/\">Part 1</a>. \n\nAnd I should also note that the column appearing as a dark silhouette in this frame still stands, along with one other. From more modern imagery I gather their shafts at least are handsome, veined Proconnesian Marble. That premium building material of the emperors and sultans was quarried on Marmara Island, in the Sea of Marmara, about 115 km (ca. 70 mi) to the southwest of here. \n\nThe Proconnesian's <i>protolith</i> (original, unmetamorphosed rock type) was limestone laid down in the Precambrian or early Paleozoic era. Much later, it was transformed into its present form in the Permian period, during the Variscan Orogeny. For what it's worth, that far-ranging mountain-building event also triggered the emplacement of various bodies of granitic magma in what is now the northern part of the Mediterranean Basin\u2014 including that which ultimately supplied the Romans with the stone for <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52813376590/in/album-72177720307451632/\">the magnificent aqueduct in Segovia, Spain</a>.\n\nWhile this concludes my various sets on buildings of Istanbul/Constantinople as seen on land, I'll later post some additional photos from the transits I made from the Dardanelles to the Black Sea, and back again.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52813376590/in/album-72177720307451632/\"><i>Architectural Geology: Turkey</i> album</a>. </b>     ",

      "description": "<i>Looking due east at the cathedral's facade (western elevation).</i>\n\nHere St. Sava's three main, geologically derived exterior building materials are on full display:\n\n- The random-coursed, rock-faced, and variably toned Fond du Lac Dolostone, a relatively rare but fine member of the Regional Silurian Dolostone family.\n\n- The Mississippian-subperiod (Lower Carboniferous) Salem Limestone of the columns, arches and trim. Architects invariably call this minutely fossiliferous calcarenite &quot;Bedford Stone&quot; or &quot;Indiana Limestone&quot; instead.\n\n- The nicely patined copper of the dome roofs. \n\nWhat a classy combination.\n\nAll the fancy sculptural detail and inscription work has been done in the Salem\u2014one of this planet's most carvable rock types. But it is the Fond du Lac, quarried near the eponymous Wisconsin city, that gives this Byzantine Revival house of worship its striking texture and visual interest.\n\n<b>This site, and many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/\"> <i>Milwaukee in Stone and Clay</i></a> (NIU Imprint of Cornell University Press, scheduled for release in early 2024). Stay tuned!\n\nAnd you'll find the other photos and descriptions of this series in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302993321\">my <i>Glory of Silurian Dolostone</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing southwestward.</i>\n\nIn this, our final view from the Mycenaean citadel, most of the green and fertile floor of the Argos Graben is obscured in a rain haze made opalescent by the returning sunshine.  \n\nStill, there's plenty to look at. Besides the foreground rocks of the battlement wall (Pliocene-to-Pleistocene Mycenae Conglomerate, Triassic-to-Jurassic Mycenae Limestone, or both), there's the exposed and very stony brown soil of the slope below and the wet and highly reflective surface of the archaeological site's access road. \n\nAnd just beyond the road, where there's that little curving hook of a driveway, is our final stop in this series. It's the so-called Treasury of Atreus, or the Tomb of Agamemnon, if you prefer to engage in some Schliemannesque romanticism (though that version of the name is not really credited to old Heinrich).\n\nIn fact, it's a magnificent, rock-ribbed tholos tomb of an unknown person or persons. If you look closely, you can see the top of its long, narrow entrance marching most of the way up its small ridge. \n\nMore on its splendid masonry in the concluding two photos in this set!\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303812060\"><i>Mycenaean Magic: Bronze-Age Stonework</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n",

One can only wonder what the eleventh-century mind (or palate) would have made of that splendid product. But I'll refrain from any reveries on the jarring juxtaposition here of medieval and modern, the sacred and the profane, and so on.\n\nWhile it may lack some of the architectural fine points of its near-contemporaries, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53168957021/in/album-72177720303792872/\">the Sts.

It's a marly limestone  quarried in such locales as Megara and Piraeus.\n\nAnd then again there's the cloisonn\u00e9 technique of placing very thin bricks as spacers between the stone blocks. And the typical brick arches, and the terra-cotta roofing tiles, with the arched <i>kalupter</i> sections alternating with the flat <i>solenes</i> pieces. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303792872\"><i>Byzantine and Late Roman Worlds</i> album</a>.</b>\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing westward.</i>\n\nAllegorical female figures were a standard trope of the Victorian-era monumental trade, and practically every American cemetery of a certain size and age has its share of these classically garbed ladies grieving, symbolizing birth and motherhood, representing one profession or another, pointing heavenward, or pensively pondering eternity, \n\nThe Hoyt Monument is notable because it sports a whole trio of such figures, nicely framed at this time of year by the spreading crown of a native Red Oak (<i>Quercus rubra</i>). \n\nAs succeeding close-ups will demonstrate, all of these sculptures and their accompanying ornamerntation look as clean-edged and unweathered as they day they were carved 140 years ago. Why? Well, for one thing, they're made of one of the greatest and most enduring of American monumental stones, the Narragansett Pier Granite.\n\nQuarried in the lovely Rhode Island town of Westerly, which I featured for botanical reasons in my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52290633179/in/album-72177720301296710/\"><i>Plant Explorer's Guide to New England</i></a>, the Narragansett Pier is a fine- and tight-grained intrusive igneous rock marketed unsurprisingly as &quot;Westerly Granite.&quot; The specific variety used here was &quot;Blue Westerly.&quot; (Stone-trade people are forever hyping pale-gray rock types as being blue, especially those that are not warm-toned enough to be buff or slightly pink.)\n\nPermian in age, the Narragansett Pier formed in masses of magma injected into the upper crust during the latter part of Alleghenian Orogeny and the assembly of the Pangaean supercontinent, when crustal compression was replaced by shearing due to the counterclockwise rotation of southeastern New England. It is widely represented in Graceland, Rosehill, Forest Home, and other Chicago and Milwaukee cemeteries. During the heyday of its production (now sadly ceased), this tough and reliasble stone was a major competitor of Vermont's Barre Granodiorite.\n\nUnfortunately, the very qualities that make the Narragansett Pier such a durable selection also make it a trifle boring. It lacks the more striking textures and ruddy tones of Wisconsin's Waupaca, Wausau, and Montello alkali-feldspar granites. Or, for that matter, the pleasing salt-and-pepper aspect of the Barre. Still, it has been a remarkable performer in a brutal continental climate that ofttimes plays havoc with such weak-sister varieties as the Shelburne and Carrara Marbles, and the Salem Limestone.   \n\n<b>To learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority to get a copy of my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nAnd to peruse the other photos and descriptions in this series, pay a visit to my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513\"><b><i>Cemetery Science</i></b> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

That was during one of many volcanic eruptions that occurred in Trans-Pecos Texas and adjoining Mexico and New Mexico in that infernal episode of prehistory.\n\nSuch big rocks, now embedded in the pyroclastic deposits exposed on Tuff Canyon's walls, are called <i>ballistic blocks</i>, no doubt because of the trajectories they described during their brief airborne phase. \n\nBallistic blocks can be distinguished from other big stone fragments carried directly along within pyroclastic flows by the <i>impact sag</i> zones located under them. I <i>think</i> I'm seeing one of those depressions under the bigger black boulder in this image, but it may be wishful thinking. \n\nAt any rate, this big chunk of Bee Mountain Basalt seems to be sitting in a coarse-textured bed more characteristic of a <i>lahar</i> (water-lubricated debris flow) than of a pyroclastic surge or flow. Lahar deposits definitely exist at this site, and I'll show another example of one in a photo to follow. \n\nRegardless of whether this shot shows true ballistic blocks or not, the fact remains that there are quite a few others nearby that unequivocaly are. As I walked about during my visit here and saw how many of these lithic projectiles are visible in this relatively small cross-section of the volcanic material that blankets this locale, I became morbidly fascinated with what it must have been like to actually be on the receiving end of this hailstorm from hell. \n\nYears before, I'd been on one active volcano (Stromboli) where globs of lava and hot rock were falling nearby, and on one other (Etna) where the same had happened a day or two before I got there, and there were freshly minted volcanic bombs lying around everywhere. But the eruption that hefted Tuff Canyon's arsenal of mafic missiles would have been orders of magnitude more powerful.  \n\nAfter poring over this photo for quite a while, I'd like to think that its two boulders are indeed ballistic blocks that landed ker-splat into a still-viscous lahar. Either that, or they landed first and were then glommed over and buried by that rocky glop.    \n\n<b>My other photos and descriptions in this series can be found in my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302655904\"><i>Canyonlands</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",

      "description": "<i> Looking at a portion of the southern elevation.</i>\n\nHere the basic building blocks that Frank Lloyd Wright used to create the Robie's powerful sense of horizontality are on full view. To get a better sense of their overall impact, see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53189462917/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 9 of this set</a>. \n\nIn this shot, however, we can best comprehend the stratigraphic sandwich that the house really is. Those deep-set square windows notwithstanding, the components of primary interest are the red, iron-flecked Roman Brick manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri, and the paler and more pedestrian Salem Limestone that flanks it. \n\nThe Salem, which just happens to be the most commonly encountered architectural rock type in the US, is much better known in the quarrying and building trades as Bedford Stone or Indiana Limestone. As I say in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52286670650/in/album-72177720301296710/\"><i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i></a>:\n\n<i>Once the urban explorer learns to recognize the Salem, it\u2019s a constant companion through life, at least if one stays in America. In the heart of every city, in each of its suburbs, in one-stop-sign towns halfway to Santa Fe, there is always some of this utterly unassuming stone lurking. It\u2019s in the official face of the shoebox post office, on the Gothic ramparts of the local high school, in the lintels and window trim of the side-street Methodist church.</i>\n\nAnd it's on some of the most architecturally distinguished buildings, too. Dating to the Mississippian subperiod (Lower Carboniferous), the Salem may seem unremittingly bland at a distance, but closer up it often reveals fascinating details. I'll address these in another close-up to follow.\n\nAt this range, what I noted in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52353519986/in/album-72177720302658037/\">Part 10</a> about Wright's clever manipulation of mortar\u2014white in the horizontal joints and red in the vertical, to accentuate the sense of unbroken strata\u2014is more apparent. \n\nThe one beef I have with Wright's Robie's design is that he, like many a heedless architect before and after him, allowed the Salem to extend down to grade. Often, when it comes into contact with the ground, and especially sidewalks, this porous rock will absorb meltwater and its dissolved deicer salts. The latter can wreak havock later on, in the form of efflorescence crusts and the case-hardening and breakdown of the rock itself. \n\nBut in this spot at least FLW's luck seems to have held. The only noticeable change to the stone's surface, besides a few scuffs, is the growth of some calciphilic algae.  \n\n<b>For much more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>.\n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, pay a visit to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302658037\">my <i>Geobrickology</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n  \n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Looking basically eastward, at this former church's southern elevation and bell tower.</i>\n\nWhat I take to be this building's main exterior material, the Late Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone, is complemented in the upper tier of tower windows with red brick of unknown date. In those  rather non-Romanesque ogee arches that brick seems to be present in quite a range of sizes, and is quite reminiscent of ancient Roman brickwork used in the same capacity.\n\nOne aspect of this photo that puzzles me a bit is the quite uniform white band atop the blue portion of the sky. It may be the straightest-edged bottom of a cloud I've ever seen. Or perhaps it's just a zone of the original slide that faded with remarkable uniformity. But if so, why was the tower's weathervane protruding into the white layer unaffected? \n\nIn my final shot of San Juan, which will follow, I'll focus on the larger significance of the time in which the Segovia Sandstone was deposited. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720307451632\"><i>Architectural Geology: Spain</i> album</a>.</b>   \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Looking at the southern side of the southwestern corner. For a good overall view of this elevation, see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53162290218/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 13</a>.</i>\n\nIt's obvious that Elizabeth and Edward Dodge were both artful and geologically astute when they arranged these Lake Michigan cobbles in their fancily ridged lime mortar.\n\nBut first, the quoin ashlar. It's highly fosssiliferous and reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone, most likely from a quarry a few miles away in Knellsville, Grafton, or Cedarburg. Visible here are shell molds and casts of brachiopods, bivalves, or both, and probably other invertebrate marine critters are represented as well. \n\nThis rock type formed on the edge of the developing crustal downwarp known as the Michigan Basin, in shallow, subtropical saltwater. This was at a time when this part of Laurentia, North America's Proterozoic-to-Early-Paleozoic predecessor,  was situated about 30 degrees south of the equator (in contrast to its current position, 43 degrees North).  \n\nAs far as the cobbles go, the Dodges lined them up, in what appears at this scale to be an attractive but noncyclical way, as follows:\n\n- BLACK: mostly Late Mesoproterozoic basalts erupted during the Midcontinent Rift event about 1.1 Ga ago; probably from Upper Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula. Also some gabbro from the same time and area, or a very dark-gray granitoid from the Canadian Shield.\n\n- GRAY OR PINK, AND SPECKLED: Paleoproterozoic to Archean granitoids from the Canadian Shield. Northern Wisconsin, Upper Michigan, or Ontario.\n\n- BONE-WHITE TO BUFF: More Regional Silurian Dolostone, from a  more northern locale in eastern Wisconsin or Upper Michigan. Some of it seems reefal; some, interreefal and devoid of fossils. (On second glance, I do also see a mold of a narrow-conic snail shell. I'll have to look up its genus.)\n\nAll of these rocks were first transported south from their outcrop locations by a Wisconsin-stage ice sheet late in the Pleistocene ice age. Then they were jostled, caressed, and tumbled into more ovoid or spheroidal forms by the lake surf.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720310008578\"><i>Geology of Fieldstone &amp; Cobblestone Buildings</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n  \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Taken, for some fool reason, in the middle of Clark Street. This is one of the North Side's busiest thoroughfares, and I'm probably lucky I wasn't run over, or at least the subject of some furious ankhing</i>.\n\nAt this range some of the details of the lower facade's Egyptianate motifs are more apparent. Up above the stout columns are scarab medallions and powder-blue and brick-red winged emblems of Amon Ra, god of the noonday sun. \n\nAll this and the white, coursed cladding were produced by the artisans of the Northwestern Terra Cotta Company. That famous firm was situated about twenty blocks west of here, on the near bank of the Chicago River's North Branch. \n\nWhile the manufacturers of the city's Chicago Common Brick usually relied on the clays of local glacial-till deposits, Northwestern needed higher-grade base material free of pebbles and other impurities. Consequently, it depended on large quantities of Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales shipped in by rail from Illinois Basin coal mines.\n\nTo the miners themselves, the underclays were just a waste product; to the Northwestern crew, the stuff of high art. But to geologists and paleontologists, they're something else again\u2014the <i>paleosols</i> or ancient soils in which the giant free-sporing scale trees of Pangaean swamp forests had grown some 300 Ma ago. \n\n<b>For more on this site, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nTo see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670488\"><i>Terra-Cottalogy</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n  \n\n\n",

      "description": "<i> Taken on a lovely, sunlit, early-April day, when the leaf buds were just beginning to break.</i>\n\nThe last I checked, there were two ways to get onto the top of the Natural Bridge: \n\n-the direct method involving a set of ancient-looking and in some cases disconcertingly loosely anchored metal ladder rungs on the vertical face of the Pounds Sandstone; and\n\n- a much more circuitous route via a footpath that mounts the bluff more gradually some distance away.\n\nWhen I've led tour groups here, the latter approach has really been the only option, given that some participants are hardly orangutans in the brachiation department. And the longer, more leisurely stroll also gives everyone a chance to see the canyon's various botanical wonders. \n\nOne of these wonders is the &quot;lichen gardens&quot; (<i>Cladonia</i> spp. primarily), that have established themselves all over the place in the thin, sandy, clifftop substrate. Some of these mini-ecosystems can be spotted in the background, as the very-light-green patches under the trees on the far side of the stone ramp. Note that even the ramp itself hosts quite a selection of lichen, moss, and algal communities.  \n\nAnd looking down at the visible portion of the Bridge's vertical face, it's possible to see some thin crossbeds exposed in this Lower Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous), fluvially deposited sandstone. For a better look at this characteristic sedimentary feature in the Pounds, see <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53181572895/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 3 of this set</a>. \n\nWhile we're at it, we might as well be a trifle dendrological, as well. The large tree with the exfoliating bark to the left is an American Sycamore (<i>Platanus occidentalis</i>). This, our native plane species, can grow to beastly sizes in the Land of Lincoln\u2014especially in bottomlands along the Illinois and Wabash Rivers. \n\n<b>For more on this beautiful and geologically fascinating locale, get a copy of my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52288266656/in/album-72177720301296710/\"><i>Geology Underfoot in Illinois</i></a>. \n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302393036\"><i>Natural History: Illinois</i> album</a>.</b> ",

      "description": "<i>Once again we're facing eastward, but this time we're looking at closer range, at the lower portion of the western elevation.</i> \n\nOf the exterior building materials on view here, two are fully documented. And the third, the  pale-buff, rock-faced ashlar, can be identified in a general sort of way with a high degree of confidence. It's almost certainly Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) from the eastern side of Wisconsin. \n\nMy guess is that it is specifically the RSD variety I call the Wauwatosa Dolostone, quarried in the Menomonee River Valley just west of Milwaukee. I know it was definitely used for one of the campus halls of Beloit College, not that far from here. However, rock virtually indistinguishable from this was also produced in other communities in the greater Cream City area.\n\nIn any event, this close carbonate cousin of true limestone was deposited some 425 Ma ago in shallow, reef-studded waters on the western fringe of the great crustal downwarp known as the Michigan Basin.\n\nOn this exterior, the Wauwatosa (or whatever) provides a dramatic contrast to the ruddier tones of the Maiden Rock Brick and the Paleoproterozoic-era Montello Granite of the pillar shafts.

      "description": "<i>Taken inside what was then the hollowed-out shell of the Palace. I want to think this was what remained of its western wall, but I'm not sure.</i>\n\nAs forlorn and even postapocalyptic as this photo seems, it shows more detail of the building's once-beautiful masonry. Obviously there have been modifications and patching with newer ashlar blocks over the centuries, but at the very least the older stuff is the Miocene-epoch Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Limestone. And some of the original red-brick belt coursing is still there, too.  \n\nI'd love to find out if the surviving timber beam remnants so prominently visible here were original as well. And what tree species were they cut from? I could speculate that they were some sort of native oak, but idle speculation is often worse than worthless. I'll continue to investigate.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303982902\"><i>Architectural Geology: Turkey</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing northeastward at the building's facade (southern elevation) as well as its western side.</i>\n\nAn arresting m\u00e9lange of three not always reconcilable architectural styles\u2014Richardsonian Romanesque, Second Empire, and Renaissance Revival\u2014Old City Hall as restored is quite the colorful Yooper showboat. (And in case you don't already know, Yooper = a resident of the UP = the Upper Peninsula.) \n\nGiven its maroons and reds and pinks, it should by rights be the City Hall of Helium, Mars, and one could easily imagine Dejah Thoris and John Carter striking a pose in front of its main entrance. But then the redness fits here, too, because Marquette was one of North America's great brownstone production centers when this edifice was erected.\n\nIt always warms the cockles of my heart when I learn that a community's elders or its <i>vox populi</i> insisted on their new municipal building being made of local materials. And such was the case here. While I don't know the story behind the roofing tiles, I've discovered that the ashlar, the Jacobsville Sandstone variety of Lake Superior Brownstone, was extracted just south of town, in what seems to have been Marquette's main quarrying district.\n\nThe other main building material, which I henceforth christen Marquette Brick, was also manufactured nearby. I need to find out what its source material was\u2014glacial till? some hematite-rich shale deposited along with the Jacobsville atop the lava flows of the Midcontinent Rift?  So far this is my one documented use of this brick type, though I'm sure there are various others.\n\nThe Marquette brand of the Jacobsville, on the other hand, was definitely exported far and wide, and in this photo set I've described and will continue to describe its uses in other cities. For example, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52713964938/in/album-72177720306314298/\">here</a>.

      "description": "<i>Taken near the end of our track, along the Boquillas Canyon Trail. We are on high ground, not far from the trailhead parking lot, and we're looking south-southwestward.</i>\n\nBefore entering the vertiginous, awe-inspiring landscape of Boquillas Canyon proper, it's only fitting that we take a look at the twists and turns of the Rio Grande a bit upstream, in less dramatic terrain. Besides the point bars and the floodplain plant communities there are the low erosional landforms on the far, Mexican side of the river. \n\nJust to the left of this frame rises the massive, fault-scarped rampart of the Sierra del Carmen, famed for its sunset colors, and the great notch of the canyon's mouth. Before venturing in among the cliffs and hoodoos of Lower Cretaceous limestone, we'll take a look at one of this national park's weirdest and most striking plants, a member of a family usually found in wetter, tropical climes. That's next.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this set and my other Big Bend series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302395234\">my <i>Natural History: Big Bend Region &amp; All of Trans-Pecos Texas</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Taken from a spot between Grave Circle A and the lip of the great wall of Mycenae's citadel (acropolis). Looking southwestward at outer excavations, the site access road, and the parking lot. Beyond lies the valley of the Argos Graben, wrapped in haze</i>.\n\nThe rectangular-chambered ruin complex in the middle ground is the so-called Oil-Merchant's House Group, sometimes rendered as the Oil-Trader's House instead. It reportedly dates to the 13th century BC, as does much of the works above it.\n\nAt this range it's difficult to tell if the surviving wall segments were constructed of Mycenae Limestone (Upper Triassic to  Middle Jurassic, quarried on surrounding hills) or the Pliocene-to-Pleistocene Mycenae Conglomerate obtained on the floor of the graben below. Probably there's some of both, as is often the case here.\n\nThere's also a nice cut of limestone-derived<i>terra rossa</i> soil horizon on the far side of the roadway. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303812060\"><i>Mycenaean Magic: Bronze-Age Stonework</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n\n",

      "description": "The Palouse River runs through a narrow cataract that drops 61 m (200 ft) into a bowl formed in the canyon which is 115 m (377 ft) deep. Exposing a large cross-section of the Columbia River Basalt Group, the current moves swiftly through a winding gorge of columnar basalt, to its southern end at the mighty Snake River.\nCarved more than 13,000 years ago, Palouse Falls is among the last active waterfalls on the Ice Age floods path. At the end of the last ice age, repeated glacial floods known as the Missoula Floods, swept across eastern Washington carving out the unique scablands landscape we see today. \nThis natural wonder was named Washington\u2019s state waterfall in 2014, when the state legislature passed a bill written by elementary school students in the nearby town of Washtucna, who had advocated for the designation. It had been dedicated as Palouse Falls State Park on June 3, 1951.",

      "description": "<i>Looking northwestward. This is the church's southern (actually southwestern) elevation, which reportedly retains much of the original building's design and materials.</i> \n\nHoly Trinity, the largest of Athenian Byzantine-era churches, has served the city's Russian Orthodox community since its nineteenth-century rehabilitation from its previous ruinous state.\n\nAs much as I love Date Palms (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>) and have extolled their use as street trees on my own native continent\u2014for example, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52513127510/in/album-72177720302478879/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/52519784414/in/album-72177720302478879/\">here</a>\u2014I dearly wish the tree in the middle of this frame had been planted elsewhere. \n\nStill, a fair portion of the characteristic Middle-Byzantine cloisonn\u00e9 masonry is visible nonetheless. A quick check on Google Earth confirms that all the palms have since been removed, though the garden planting at far left has survived.  \n\nInterestingly, Holy Trinity is essentially a three-quarters-size replica of the much more famous <i>katholikon</i> of the Hosios Loukas Monastery, built not that long before in the wilds of Boeotia.\n\nRegarding this church, I'm forced as usual to speculate about the geologic origins of the rough-faced, puckery, and presumably pretty soft ashlar that is set between those typically wafer-thin, double-coursed bricks. Sources I've consulted have much to say about the building's history, but not about the identity of its stone. But the rock does seem to be a dead ringer for <i>poros</i>\u2014the Pliocene-epoch marly and fossiliferous limestone quarried in Megara and Piraeus.\n\nHoly Trinity Church is also notable for being dercorated with the kind of pseudo-Kufic symbols so strikingly displayed on the contemporary <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53128047076/in/album-72177720303792872/\">Holy Apostles Church</a> in the Agora. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be visible from this image's vantagepoint. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303792872\"><i>Byzantine and Late Roman Worlds</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing westward and looking at the midsection of the Entrance Gate's eastern side.</i>\n\nAnyone familiar with the Windy City's iconic Water Tower &amp; Pumping Station will have no trouble identifying this structure's architect\u2014William C. Boyington. That man certainly had a thing for turrets and castellation. And, of course, for Lemont-Joliet Dolostone, the Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) variety so widely used in the city's formative decades. Here it's present in rock-faced and regular-to-random-coursed form. \n\nWinter is definitely the time to see this fine display of carbonate sedimentary rock at its best, when it's not partially obscured with the foliage of vines that have been permitted to establish such a substantial toehold here. Note the stone's subtly varying weathering tints that give the Lemont-Joliet and other RSD types so much warmth and character. \n\nThe topographic high on which the cemetery is located is the Rosehill (or Rose Hill) Spit, an elongated, north-south deposit of sand and gravel created by longshore currents approximately 11.5 ka ago, during the Calumet highstand of ancestral Lake Chicago.\n\nOriginally this landform was dubbed Roe's Hill, after an early property owner. But in the cemetery's charter papers it was mistakenly listed as the phonetically identical Rose Hill, which in latter days has been elided into Rosehill. \n\nThe fact that the plaque above Entrance Gate's archway uses the modern form of the name makes me think it is of relatively recent date.\n\n<b>To learn much more about this site and 200 others in the Windy City, make it your top personal priority to get a copy of my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nAnd to peruse the other photos and descriptions in this series, pay a visit to my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670513\"><b><i>Cemetery Science</i></b> album</a>.</b>\n\n",

      "description": "The main hills are massive, you really have to be here to get the feel of just how large they are. The Painted Hills unit itself is 12.67 km2 (3132 acres)\nAveraging about 670 m (2,200 ft) in elevation, the monument has a dry climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about 32 \u00b0C  (90 \u00b0F) to winter lows below freezing. \nThe Painted Hills began to form 35 million years ago when pumice and ash from volcanic eruptions in the Cascade Mountains traveled 161km (100 m) east and settled over the area. Once there, the ash and other sediments were mixed by natural processes including the flow of water, growth of plants, and the movement of animals. Over time, this led to oxidation of the ash on the surface. Buried under new layers and deposits, the ash turned into soils by way of compaction and cementation. With more time and weathering, the exterior surfaces of The Painted Hills were worn into clay. Now, they are primarily made of hard claystone layers. A true masterpiece of the ages that continue to tell stories once unknown of the ancient past.\n\n(you can not get close to the 'toes', these images were taken with a long lens)",

      "description": "<i>Facing northeastward.</i>\n\nThis harmonious blend of brick and stone is one of Frank Lloyd Wright's more famous Prairie Style designs, and it's also one of his most geologically savvy and significant. It demonstrates the imprint of Midwestern stratigraphy on the architect's mind. \n\nThe flat-lying sedimentary strata of Wright's early stomping grounds, southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, are elegantly restated here in alternating elements of red St. Louis Brick and buff Salem Limestone. As succeeding photos will show, Wright and his brickmasons took special pains to emphasize the sense of horizontality he'd already seen expressed in the regional outcrops.\n\nThe St. Louis Brick, iron-flecked and shaped in long, shallow Roman form, was manufactured from the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous) Cheltenham Clay, an ancient soil horizon in which giant coal-swamp trees once grew. It was mined directly under that great city on the Mississippi.\n\nThe Salem Limestone, better known to architects as &quot;Bedford Stone&quot; or &quot;Indiana Limestone,&quot; is the one most prevalent architectural rock type in the US. Composed of marine-animal fossil fragments naturally cemented together with calcite, it's Mississippian (Lower Carboniferous) in age. \n\n<b>For much more on this site and 200 others in the Windy City, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>.\n\nAnd to see the other photos and descriptions of this series, pay a visit to <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302658037\">my <i>Geobrickology</i> album</a>.</b>",

      "description": "<i>Looking northeastward at the facade (western elevation) and a portion of the southern elevation.</i>\n\nEven when I visited it in 1978, this former house of worship had been a private residence for almost three-quarters of a century. Nowadays it serves as the Museo Zuloaga.\n\nSan Juan de los Caballeros was the oldest Romanesque structure I saw when I was in Segovia. However, those conversant with this architectural style will immediately spot one unusual feature here: the great Gothic arch of the entryway. \n\nI assume this impressive portal was added at some point after the initial construction; the Gothic mode is usually thought to have originated more than a hundred years after San Juan was raised. But the descriptions of this specific site I've found so far do not address this issue\u2014other to note that that section of the facade also incorporates remains of an earlier Visigothic (6th century) church.\n\nIn any case, it's evident after checking Google Earth Street View that the building has been at least partially renovated since I photographed it. For one thing, the badly deteriorated ashlar under the blind arches has, I gather, been replaced or reconstituted. My suposition is that it is (or at least was) one of the town's two standard architectural-rock types, the Upper Cretaceous Segovia Sandstone. \n\nLooking at the crumbling stonework, it reminds me a lot of other case-hardened sandstone I've seen elsewhere. But, as I keep having to say, provenance is lacking.\n\nAnother change for the better one can see today is that the wonderful arched porch colonnades that were so indecorously walled up in this image are open again, though the ones in front are now backed by decidedly non-Romanesque glass windows.  \n\nI wonder if the higher degree of destructive stone weathering I saw at this location was at all linked to San Juan's location, overlooking the north-facing cliff of the city's rocky heights. Or were the masons of the late 11th century just less selective in choosing good-quality sandstone than their 12th- and 13th-century successors?\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720307451632\"><i>Architectural Geology: Spain</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n ",

      "description": "<i>Facing southeastward. The porch and main entrance are on the building's western side; also visible is the considerably less altered northern elevation. </i>\n\nThis vantagepoint may not reveal the full impact of the original cobblestone exterior or the complementing Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) quoins the way <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53162290218/in/dateposted-public/\">the Part 13 photo</a> does. But at least it shows the Lannon Dolostone pillars and bay-window base of the 1930s addition to good effect. \n\nThe Lannon, a RSD variety quarried to this day about 20 mi (32 km) to the southwest of Port Washington, is often extracted in thin-bedded, flaggy sections more suitable for veneer than real ashlar blocks. Most often it is face-mounted in pieces of varying size and shape, in random-course fashion. And so it is here.\n\nOne of the most attractive aspects of the Lannon\u2014besides its smaller amount of spalling and exfoliation compared to northeastern Illinois' Lemont-Joliet variety\u2014is its polychromatic weathering profile. Some sections retain their original pale-gray color for decades, whereas others turn warmer tones of buff, gold, and even ocher.\n\nIn the shots that follow we'll focus more fully on the Dodge House's original building materials. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720310008578\"><i>Geology of Fieldstone &amp; Cobblestone Buildings</i> album</a>.</b> \n ",

      "description": "<i>Looking northward at the warehouse's southwestern and southeastern elevations.</i>\n\nWhat at first glance may seem an uninteresting, utilitarian structure is in fact one of the Windy City's most delightful expressions of architectural noncontextuality\u2014a concept I'm always willing to admire, praise, and promote. As will become apparent in the photos that follow, the Reebie Warehouse boldly dares to relate to nothing whatsoever around it, and not even to itself.\n\nTo really appreciate the salutary incongruity present here, you need to lower your gaze to the first story of the building's Clark Street facade. It was there that, at the request of the original owners, designer George S. Kingsley provided something rarely seen in storage warehouses, at least since the Ptolemaic Dynasty: a whopping dose of Ancient Egyptian design motifs. \n\nThis remarkable Roaring-Twenties riff on pharaonic magnificence, breathtaking in its cognitive dissonance, was executed in polychrome terra-cotta crafted twenty blocks to the west, in Chicago's Northwestern works. \n\nNorthwestern's base material was derived from Pennsylvanian-subperiod (Upper Carboniferous) underclays and marine shales unearthed in the bituminous-coal mines of the Illinois Basin, and then shipped up to the big city by rail. \n\nThe pictures that follow will concentrate, at considerably closer range, on the wonderful terra-cotta cladding that was produced from this 300-Ma-old material.\n\n<b>For more on this site, see my book <i>Chicago in Stone and Clay</i>, described at <a href=\"http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501765063/chicago-i..</a>. \n\nTo see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302670488\"><i>Terra-Cottalogy</i> album</a>.</b> ",

Still, the strata of the thin-bedded Pounds Sandstone are perfectly visible with their well-preserved <i>crossbedding</i>.\n\nThe Pounds, a member of the Lower Pennsylvanian (early Upper Carboniferous) Caseyville Formation, was deposited by streams like the  Bell Smith Springs canyon's own modern-day Bay Creek.

      "description": "This detail of the Amphitheater's interior focuses on both the Ancient Roman Brick facing and the Ancient Roman Concrete exposed above and below it. \n\nThe latter building material is so alien to our modern conception of concrete\u2014the smooth-textured Ready Mix stuff that's poured out of a truck and forms something pretty reminiscent of compact, slightly sandy limestone\u2014that we think of it as stonemasonry instead. And here it does appear to be about 1 part lime-pozzolana mortar to 9 parts cobbles (or brick fragments or broken tiles, or whatever the exact roster of aggregrate ingedients is in this case).\n\nBut how well it worked. When I think of all the less-than-a-century-old concrete structures in my own country that are in bad need of repair, I have all the more respect for Imperial builders and architects who accomplished so much with such rudimentary technology, and with so little formal understanding of chemistry and materials science. \n\n<b>For more on the Colosseum's geology and geoengineering, see the other photos and descriptions of this series in my\n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303982812\"><i>Architectural Geology: Italy</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Taken facing east. My razor-sharp directional sense thereby deduces that we're looking at the building's western elevation.</i>\n\nIn my humble opinion, one of the greatest glories of American architecture is found far from its biggest cities, in its nineteenth-century rural county courthouses. And if they happen to be constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, as here, so much the better. \n\nThese distinctive structures are the incarnation of local civic pride in the last places in this country where democracy still works. Everything about them hearkens back to a very different world. In fact, they're miniature worlds in themselves. Their ceiling-fanned, oak-paneled hallways and clerks' offices are populated with warmhearted people named Vern and Darlene, and tend to give off a composite scent of Lysol, prairie soil, floor wax, and legal documents aged like fine wine in century-old filing cabinets.\n\nThere's so much to explore, inside and out. What's visible here is an especially impressive array of building materials, all obtained, in an admirable display of Badger State solidarity, from Wisconsin sources. The Green County Courthouse and adjoining Civil War Monument\u2014there always has to be an adjoining Civil War Monument\u2014are so geologically rich that I'm going to devote several posts to them. At least several.\n\nThe most striking component of the exterior is that luridly lovely red brick. It could easily pass for a premium-grade Philadelphia facing variety, but according to local documents it actually hails from the Upper-Mississippi-Valley hamlet of Maiden Rock, about 250 road mi (402 km) northwest of Monroe. Whether its clay was mined from Quaternary deposits laid down by the Father of the Waters, I don't know. This production locality was not cited in any publications on Wisconsin brickmaking I've come across so far.   \n\nThe contrasting yellowish-buff, rock-faced ashlar is described in my sources simply as &quot;limestone.&quot; But it's actually dolostone. For reasons I'll discuss in future photo descriptions, I don't think it's the locally quarried Plattevile-Galena rock of Ordovician age, but rather reefal Regional Silurian Dolostone from Wauwatosa or some other place in the eastern section of the state. \n\nAlso on display, if just barely, is the ruddy and almost supernaturally hard Montello Granite in the shafts of the porch pillars. It formed as part of magma emplacement connected with a megavolcanic eruption event in the Paleoproterozoic. But more on that anon.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302395101\"><i>Architectural Geology: Southwestern Wisconsin</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n \n\n\n ",

      "description": "<i>Taken in what was then the roofless shell of the Palace. I believe we're facing the junction of the western and southern walls, but after all these years I can't be sure.</i>\n\nThe heavy growth of moss or some other type of vegetation on the vertical surfaces makes the pattern of masonry quite indistinct in places. But a little scrutiny reveals that there's the same alternation of Miocene-epoch Bak\u0131rk\u00f6y Limestone with horizontal bands of red brick seen in <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53158000485/in/dateposted-public/\">Part 3</a>.\n\nNone of the free-range fowl who followed me into the ruined building are visible in this shot, but they'll make their appearance in a later image. I'd like to think they were inspired by my own geological and architectural curiosity. But they, being true to their chicken-brained nature, probably just thought I was there to feed them.\n\nSome of the upper window arches clearly show the decorative effect of stone alternating with thick-mortared bricks. There also seem to be some much more recently added stone or concrete blocks farther down. They are of a much more uniform shape than the rest of the ashlar. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303982902\"><i>Architectural Geology: Turkey</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n",

      "description": "<i>Facing northeastward and toward the cathedral's facade (western elevation) and southern elevation.</i>\n\nThis handsome Neo-Byzantine edifice is one of the most striking and effective twentieth-century expressions of Regional Silurian Dolostone (RSD) I've seen. \n\nGeologically speaking, St. Sava is particularly distinctive because it's clad not in the usual latter-day RSD selection, Lannon Dolostone, but in very similar rock quarried about 40 mi (65 km) farther north, on the southern outskirts of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. \n\nThe Fond du Lac Dolostone on display here is a subtly varicolored rock type that, like the Lannon, is shown to its best effect as random-coursed, rock-faced cladding. \n\nIn addition, the church exterior features portal elements, trim, and window surrounds of light-gray Salem (&quot;Bedford,&quot; &quot;Indiana&quot;) Limestone. This Mississippian-subperiod (Lower Carboniferous) biocalcarenite is often used as a blander and much more carvable complement to RSD varieties. \n\nAlso notice the copper roofs of the domes, nave, and transepts. In the course of fifty-five years, they've reach their metal's end-state of weathering\u2014the bluish-green patina characteristic of copper sulfate and copper carbonate compounds.\n\n<b>This site, and many others in Milwaukee County, will be discussed at greater length in my forthcoming book <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53241541841/in/dateposted-public/\"> <i>Milwaukee in Stone and Clay</i></a> (NIU Imprint of Cornell University Press, scheduled for release in early 2024).

      "description": "<i> Taken along the western side of Rio Grande Village Road, about 0.2 road mi (0.4 km) northeast of the big Tornillo Creek Bridge. This vantagepoint is a few tens of meters/yards northeast of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/53152838457/in/dateposted-public/\">the Part 6 photo</a>.</i> \n\nI arrived at this site none too soon. A few minutes later the shadow evident at bottom had obscured even the crest of this rise. As it was, though, the low-angle light of late afternoon beautifully highlighted the dike of igneous rock cutting through Upper Cretaceous Pen Formation shale and claystone. The Pen beds closest to the dike were cooked into somewhat harder form when the magma forced its way into them. This is a very localized version of what geologists call <i>contact metamorphism</i>.\n\nAlso getting its last dose of direct sun is a scraggily cluster of what I suppose is Faxon Yucca (<i>Yucca faxoniana</i>). This species is better known in Trans-Pecos Texas as Dagger\u2014a fitting tribute to its lethally pointed, rigid, and sword-shaped leaves.  \n\nAs you can see for yourself on Google Earth, in both aerial and street views, the dike actually runs straight as an arrow on both sides of the road. But, as noted in the previous description, I can find no source that identifies its exact petrologic composition. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this set and my other Big Bend series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720302395234\">my <i>Natural History: Big Bend Region &amp; All of Trans-Pecos Texas</i> album</a>.</b>",

      "description": "<i>Facing one of the shaft-grave walls in this famous burial complex.</i> \n\nWhile the unmortared rubble blocks on view in this shot are probably too small to be considered <i>cyclopean</i>\u2014the help of a mythical one-eyed giant wouldn't have been required to heft them\u2014they are just about as diverse in shape as they are monolithic in the type of stone they represent. \n\nThe fact that the larger chunks of rock are being held in place by so many wedgelike smaller ones makes me wonder whether this wall was largely rebuilt in the nineteenth century AD or later by archaeological excavators. I have trouble imagining all those tidy little bits surviving in their appointed nooks since the Late Bronze Age.\n\nHowever recent or ancient this particular masonry is, the material it's made of, the locally quarried Mycenae Limestone, has a history that stretches back more than 200 Ma. It was in the span from the Upper Triassic to the Middle Jurassic periods of the Mesozoic era that this sedimentary rock began as limey mud deposited on a carbonate platform in the Tethys Ocean. At that time, that great saltwater seaway stretched all the way from Spain to what is now Southeast Asia. \n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions of this series, visit my \n<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303812060\"><i>Mycenaean Magic: Bronze-Age Stonework</i> album</a>.</b> \n\n",

      "description": "<i> Looking west-southwestward at the church's eastern elevation.</i>\n\nI'm not sure what sort of repair or restoration work was underway during my visit, but I am sure that nothing would have tempted me to walk up that ramshackle timber ramp.  \n\nOne of the distinctive design features of Sts. Theodores is that has three triple-sided apses. I would love to think there was some doubling down on Trinitarian symbolism going on here, but I may just be playing too much into it.\n\nIn any event, this vantagepoint offers a great view both of the pitted &quot;poros&quot; ashlar\u2014probably either Piraeus Limestone or Megara Limestone, both of which are marly, highly fossiliferous, and Pliocene\u2014and the brick-and-stone cloisonn\u00e9 masonry so typical of Athenian Middle Byzantine style.\n\nIn this shot, the terra-cotta <i>solenes</i> and <i>kalupter</i> tiles look pretty mossy and patched in places with some whitish material (concrete?). Much more modern imagery on Google Earth Street View shows the roof in better shape overall. \n\nAlso note the striking brick-and-thick-mortar patterns adorning the upper reaches of the arched windows.\n\n<b>To see the other photos and descriptions in this series, visit my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/196253572@N05/albums/72177720303792872\"><i>Byzantine and Late Roman Worlds</i> album</a>.</b>\n\n\n",
